### A static site using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
This is mainly a portfolio hilighting some browser based generative art projects and apps I've written.
- The [__landing__](https://un1tz3r0.github.io/index.html) page shows off some modern css layout and web component know-how, not to mention a strong sense of aesthetics and graphic design. Sorta. _Well, I liek it anyway._
  It has a directory of subpages in a reactive card layout, which currently has the following links, with a short description of each:
  - [__paisl__](https://un1tz3r0.github.io/paisl/index.html) is an interactive generative SVG redering of appolonian gasket geometry, based on solving Apollonius' famous three circles thingy.
  - [__squid__](https://un1tz3r0.github.io/squid/index.html) is a (three.js)[https://github.com/mrdoob/three] interactive seamlessly looping animated tentacle ball that i have frequently seen during synaesthetic experiences.
  - [__x-fade__](https://un1tz3r0.github.io/audio/index.html) is a simple endlessly shuffling, crossfading playlist of ambient sound mounds created with google's AI Test Kitchen generative text->audio tool.
